      <ol>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Spray inside of slow-cooker with non-stick cooking spray.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Pour an inch of barbeque sauce into the bottom of the slow-cooker crock.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Score the fat on top of the roast in a crisscross pattern, being sure to cut through the fat layer.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Place the roast in the slow-cooker and pour 8 ounces of BBQ sauce over the roast.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Place the onion wedges around the roast.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Cover the slow-cooker with the lid. Set the temperature to HIGH and cook the roast (unopened) for 6 hours or until the meat can easily be pierced with a fork.</span></li>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Transfer the roast to a cutting board, remove the fat layer, and use two forks to pull it apart. Hence the name, <i>pulled pork</i>.</span></li>

      <h3 class="component">For the Coleslaw</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="stepinfo">Remove the core and outer layers from the cabbage. Cut the cabbage into pieces sized to fit into a food processor. Grate the cabbage in the food processor or with a grater.

        <li><span class="stepinfo">Grate the carrots the same size as the cabbage.</span></li>

        <li><span class="stepinfo">Combine the sugar and apple cider vinegar. Whisk together until sugar has dissolved. Add mayonnaise, celery seed, black pepper and chives. Whisk again, taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.</span></li>
